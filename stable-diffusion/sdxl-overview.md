I've seen some other image prompts make extensive use of parentheses and nested parentheses. I think that's a different (non stable-diffusion based) model. Although I just read something on reddit that you can emphasize specific aspects of an image. 
For example: "A portrait of a young woman ((smiling:1.1)) with freckles" - smile and freckles will be more pronounced due to the increased weight.

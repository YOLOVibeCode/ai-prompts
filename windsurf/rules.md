# üö® WINDSURF PROJECT RULES - Place them in the root ./windsurf/rules.md

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES - READ FIRST**

### **SIMPLICITY FIRST (CRITICAL)**

**DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE. Keep it simple, focused, and practical.**

- **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - no premature abstractions
- **Avoid over-engineering** - resist architectural speculation
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**
- **No design patterns until absolutely necessary**
- **Always read a README.md or and root directly markdown to refresh our context memory

### **EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE (REQUIRED)**

**ALL components MUST communicate through a SIMPLIFIED event-driven pattern.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è SIMPLICITY WARNING: Do NOT overcomplicate the event architecture. Start simple and evolve only when necessary.**

- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate only through events, never direct references
- **Event Bus Pattern**: Central event dispatcher for all cross-component communication
- **Domain Events**: Events represent meaningful business occurrences
- **Start with basic pub/sub** - resist complex patterns until proven necessary
- **Event Sourcing** (ONLY when appropriate): Store events as source of truth - NOT by default
- **CQRS** (ONLY when beneficial): Separate read/write models - avoid unless complexity demands it

#### **Event-Driven Toolkit Recommendation**
Before implementing custom event infrastructure, **ASK THE USER** if they want to use established, battle-tested event-driven toolkits:

**Popular Options:**
- **EventEmitter3** (Node.js) - Lightweight, fast event emitter
- **RxJS** - Reactive programming with observables
- **MediatR** (.NET) - In-process messaging patterns
- **EventBus** (various languages) - Simple pub/sub implementations
- **Apache Kafka** / **Redis** (for distributed systems)

**Decision Criteria:**
- Is the toolkit actively maintained?
- Does it have comprehensive test coverage?
- Does it follow established event-driven patterns?
- Is the learning curve justified by project complexity?

### **INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

**NOTHING should be created unless it's through a properly segregated interface.**

- **ALL business logic MUST implement interfaces**
- **NO direct class instantiation** - only through interface contracts
- **Clients depend ONLY on methods they actually use**
- **Interfaces are behavioral contracts, NOT implementation blueprints**
- **Event handlers MUST implement event interface contracts**

### **TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (REQUIRED)**

**ALL business logic MUST be validated through CLI test harnesses BEFORE implementation.**

- **100% CLI test coverage** for all core interfaces
- **Mock implementations** validate interface contracts first
- **CLI tests exercise full business workflows**
- **Event-driven flows MUST be testable via CLI**
- **Mock event dispatchers** for testing event flows
- **No concrete implementation without passing CLI tests**

### **STRICT DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

```
1. Interface First         ‚Üí Define interface contract (including event contracts)
2. Event Schema           ‚Üí Define event payload structures
3. CLI Test              ‚Üí Create CLI test harness with mock events
4. Mock Implementation   ‚Üí Validate interfaces with mock event flows
5. Concrete Implementation ‚Üí Only after CLI tests pass
```

### **EVENT-DRIVEN SPECIFIC RULES**

**üö® KEEP IT SIMPLE: Resist over-engineering the event system. Most applications need basic pub/sub, not complex event architectures.**

- **Event Naming**: Use past-tense verbs (e.g., `UserRegistered`, `OrderCompleted`)
- **Event Immutability**: Events should be immutable once created
- **Start with in-memory events** - move to persistent/distributed only when scaling demands it
- **Event Versioning**: Plan for event schema evolution (but don't over-engineer v1)
- **Error Handling**: Failed event processing should not crash the system
- **Idempotency**: Event handlers should be idempotent when possible
- **Avoid event chains** - if Event A always triggers Event B, consider if they should be one event

### **NO GENERIC NAMING CONVENTIONS (REQUIRED)**

- **NO GENERIC NAMES Principle**: After generating the code, scan all class, method, and variable names. If any name is too generic (like Helper, Processor, Task, Info, Data, etc.), replace it with a name that describes its exact role in the application domain.
- **Event-Specific**: Avoid generic event names like `DataChanged` or `UpdateEvent`

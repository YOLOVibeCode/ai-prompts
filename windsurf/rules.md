# üö® WINDSURF PROJECT RULES - Place them in the root ./windsurf/rules.md

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES - READ FIRST**

### **SIMPLICITY FIRST (CRITICAL)**

**DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE. Keep it simple, focused, and practical.**

- **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - no premature abstractions
- **Avoid over-engineering** - resist architectural speculation
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**
- **No design patterns until absolutely necessary**
- **Always read a README.md or and root directly markdown to refresh our context memory

### **INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

**NOTHING should be created unless it's through a properly segregated interface.**

- **ALL business logic MUST implement an interfaces**
- **NO direct class instantiation** - only through interface contracts
- **Clients depend ONLY on methods they actually use**
- **Interfaces are behavioral contracts, NOT implementation blueprints**

### **TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (REQUIRED)**

**ALL business logic MUST be validated through CLI test harnesses BEFORE implementation.**

- **100% CLI test coverage** for all core interfaces
- **Mock implementations** validate interface contracts first
- **CLI tests exercise full business workflows**
- **No concrete implementation without passing CLI tests**

### **STRICT DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

```
1. Interface First    ‚Üí Define interface contract
2. CLI Test          ‚Üí Create CLI test harness
3. Mock Implementation ‚Üí Validate interface with mocks
4. Concrete Implementation ‚Üí Only after CLI tests pass
```
